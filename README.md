# Email/link tracker list


This is an adblock syntax list of email link tracking. I will also at some point add a wildcard one that will catch most that are not on this list, with the expense of some false positives.
My intention with this list is for it to be used as an allow-list on a DNS adblocker so you can open emails again properly. But there's no reason you couldn't use this as a blocklist instead, if that's your thing.
